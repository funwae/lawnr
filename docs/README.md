# Lawnr Documentation

This directory contains the specification documents for the Lawnr project, a mobile-first marketplace and operations platform connecting homeowners with lawn-care and landscaping contractors.

## Specification Versions

The Lawnr specification has been developed iteratively across multiple versions:

### [Spec v0.1](./specs/spec_v0.1.md)
**Overview & Vision Document**

The foundational specification covering:
- Project overview, mission, and value proposition
- User stories and flows for homeowners, contractors, and platform administrators
- Feature list (MVP vs Enhanced features)
- High-level data model and entity relationships
- API endpoints and backend logic overview
- Frontend UI skeleton and screen inventory
- Infrastructure, security, and compliance considerations
- Monetization and business model
- Branding, UX/UI, and visual identity guidelines
- Roadmap and phases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Tech stack rationale

### [Spec v0.2](./specs/spec_v0.2.md)
**Expanded Technical Specification**

Builds upon v0.1 with:
- Detailed data schema (relational tables and entities)
- Expanded API specification with request/response payload examples
- High-level architecture and tech stack recommendations
- Refined UI skeleton and component inventory
- Business logic, workflows, and edge case handling
- MVP vs Post-MVP prioritization and milestones
- Detailed security, compliance, and risk considerations
- Pre-launch checklist and implementation requirements

### [Spec v0.3](./specs/spec_v0.3.md)
**Engineering-Ready Blueprint**

The most detailed specification including:
- Complete SQL database schema with table definitions
- Detailed API endpoint specifications with JSON request/response examples
- Project folder structure and file organization template
- Tech stack and integration recommendations
- Implementation considerations and best practices
- Notes on scalability, localization, and future expansion

## Document Evolution

- **v0.1**: Initial comprehensive spec covering vision, features, and high-level architecture
- **v0.2**: Expanded technical details, detailed schema, and API specifications
- **v0.3**: Engineering-ready blueprint with SQL schema, API specs, and project structure

## Development Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for a comprehensive development roadmap organized by phases:
- **Phase 1**: MVP Completion (Weeks 1-12)
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced Features (Weeks 13-20)
- **Phase 3**: Monetization & Growth Infrastructure (Weeks 21-28)
- **Phase 4**: Service Expansion & Verticalization (Weeks 29-36)
- **Phase 5**: Long-Term Optimization & Scaling (Weeks 37+)

The roadmap includes detailed tasks, success metrics, and ongoing maintenance requirements.

## Usage

These specifications serve as the master documentation for:
- Development planning and implementation
- Technical architecture decisions
